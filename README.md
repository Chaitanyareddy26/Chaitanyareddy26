# Hi, I'm Chaitanya 👋

**Senior Java Developer | Microservices | Cloud‑Native | Full‑Stack**

I’m a senior Java developer with over 7 years of experience designing, developing and deploying enterprise applications across finance, healthcare and retail. I specialize in building scalable microservices, event‑driven systems and full‑stack solutions using Java, Spring Boot, React/Angular, Kafka and AWS. I love turning monolithic applications into cloud‑native microservices and enabling secure, observable platforms.
